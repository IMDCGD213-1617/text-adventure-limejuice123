# Text Adventure

Study the provided source code for a text adventure game, you will find a stub class for the Item object and there is no input handling bar allowing the player to quit the game.

Implement the Item class, consider all the possible actions and methods it may need. Using that implementation, develop a suitable input algorithm to handle at least the following commands (you can add any further commands you consider necessary):

-	Look
-	Walk / Move (The exit class may provide some ideas for this)
-	Inventory
-	Take
-	Use

Think through the requirements of parsing the input text and how to handle any given input. Write a 1000 word report with regards to your algorithm development â€“ explain your choices and show your research.

You may add any additional classes you feel are necessary. There is a basic set of locations already implemented within the Game constructor for reference; you do not need to keep any of it and are encouraged to produce your own.
